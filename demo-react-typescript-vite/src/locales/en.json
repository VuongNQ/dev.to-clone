Keep in mind that any changes you make after we have done the optimization task can easily affect our final testing result.

Those changes include but are not limited to:<br/>- Change your theme template/structure <br/>- Change the design of your website (font, images, videos, contents, etc.) <br/>- Add more products to your store <br/> - Add more third-party apps <br/>- Delete our optimize code without our notice <br/> In that case, we can do a Free technical analysis for you, and if needed, you would need to open a new request for us to optimize your store again."
